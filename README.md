This is a small project made using the bevy game engine. Currently there is functionality to place a capital, capture hexes and defeat enemies. Units are composed of a vec of keywords inspired by the card game Legends of Runeterra, which give them special abilities. Such as Nimble which lets a unit take the place of its opponent on kill.

In addition different unit types have unique tiles they can move to and attack to.

In the future coins will be used to buy units and place them in allied territory, with the goal of the game to be to take your opponents capital.
